# Simple Calculator Project

## Overview
This project is a simple calculator program written in C. It performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We developed it using Git for version control to track changes and manage our work.

## Instructions for Running the Calculator

1. **Compile the Code**:
   To compile the calculator program, open a PowerShell terminal in the project directory and run:
   ```powershell
   gcc calculator.c -o calculator

Git Commands Used in the Project

Here are the main Git commands we used:

git init - Initializes a new Git repository.
git add <file> - Stages changes (e.g., adding calculator.c and README.md).
git commit -m "<message>" - Commits changes to the repository with a message describing the update.
git branch <branch_name> and git checkout <branch_name> - Creates a new branch and switches to it.
git merge <branch_name> - Merges changes from a branch into the main branch.
git status - Shows the current status of the working directory and staged changes.
git push origin main - Pushes committed changes to the remote repository.
